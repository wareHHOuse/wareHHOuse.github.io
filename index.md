# The wareHHOuse
This is the home of DiSk++ and ProtoN, two numerical codes for the fast prototyping of polyhedral numerical methods for Partial Differential Equations.

## DiSk++
DiSk++ is a C++ template library for the fast prototyping of Discontinuous Skeletal (DiSk) polyhedral discretization methods for PDEs. It was born to support the development of the HHO method and supports fully polyhedral elements in all dimensions. The main authors of DiSk++ are:
 * Matteo Cicuttin (Politecnico di Torino)
 * Nicolas Pignet (EDF R&D)
 * Karol Cascavita (Politecnico di Torino)

## ProtoN
ProtoN is the smaller brother of DiSk++. At the beginning it was meant as a throw-away code to experiment with unfitted HHO methods, but later it started to live its own life. It supports just triangular and cartesian meshes on the unit square, but it has all the machinery to support unfitted interfaces. The main authors of ProtoN are:
 * Matteo Cicuttin (Politecnico di Torino) - original developer but not at all the main contributor
 * Guillaume Delay (Sorbonne Universit√©)
 * Romain Mottier (CEA, CERMICS & INRIA)
 * Stefano Piccardo (CERMICS)
